# Privacy   :- Means that no one knows what you do like if you entered your house people can see that you entered you house they don't know what you are doing in your house
# Anonymity :- Means that people can see what you're doing but they don't know who you are

# Privacy Can't be achieved easily on the interent cause the internet have recoursed not owned by you cause if visit a website the ISP (internet service provider) will know

## Tor (The Onion Router) ##
# 1- Network of servers designed to improve anonymity and privacy
# 2- Most common anonymizing network
# 3- Connected computers can be configured to offer hidden or onion services
# 4- Onion routing was designed by the US army to protect their communications 
# 5- Tor depends on onion routing
# 6- You can use tor not for accessing the dark web only you can also visit clear net with more privacy and anonymity

# When you open any website they know your location, browser, operating system and much more

# We Have Privacy In TOR Browser because it has alot of servers (computers) connected with each others and when we send data through the tor network it will bounce over a minimum of 3 servers before it goes to the destination

# Hidden Services/Onion is a services provided by a anonymous guy or organization and it's inside the TOR network when you access it you will not know who they are and they will not know who you are (محدش عارف باع ايه لمين وبكام)


# To access the dark web there's three ways
# 1- Use TOR browser => Simplest but not best.
# 2- Tails => It's a linux distrobution designed for anonymity and privacy and it's a great solution
# 3- Qubes with whonix => Best Way and qubes is an operating system and whonix is a gateway it's very secure 

# when you exit from the tor network to your destination (google.com) the exit node will not be private cause it uses the http protocol and you need to trust the provider of this node

# TOR Browser
# 1- Modified version of firefox ESR
# 2- Uses the TOR network by default
# 3- Fully patched from all known vulnerabilities to make sure that it is as secure as possible
# 4- Disables insecure features/plugins
# 5- Forces all the websites to use the HTTPS Protocol to provide more privacy and to solve the exit node problem
# 6- Disables scripts like js scripts using noscript plugin
# 7- With TOR borwser all the traffics sent throught the browser it is in the tor network
# 8- Never use tor browser in the full screen mode because any hacker can identify what kind of labtop or computer you're using
# 9- Always check for updates
# 10- New identify option in tor browser will remove all of yours cache and remove all your data and histroy and the browser wil reload the brwoser with new IP

# When you download the TOR browser from the torproject website you must download the signature file and then download the Gpg4win program to see if the signature matches the tor app you download cause the file you downloaded could be modified the ISP or a hacker
