# The whole purpose of networking is to send data from one machine to another.
# Switches => A device that connects network devices together, Is just a next generation of hubs that combine hubs with another device called a bridge, and they can use logic
    # to learn which physical ports are attached to which devices based on their mac addresses and in this way they can send data to specific devices in the network.
# WAP ( wireless access point ) => Are devices that allows wireless devices to cnnect into a wired network, acts like a wireless hub.
# WAN (wide area network) Links => It simply connects an internal netwrok to an external one.
# IEEE 802.3 refers to Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 refer to Wi-Fi.
# OSI model is also called OSI Stack and reference model.
# IPX stands for Internetwork Packet Exchange but it's killed when ipv4 or ipv6 appeared.


############# MAC Adresses #############
# Physical addressing system of a device which operates on a logical topology.
# It will be like 6 pairs of characters separated by :
# Uses a 48-bit address assigned to a network interface card (NIC).
# It consists of 12 characters in hexadecimal.
# Each number or character is considered as 4 bits.
# The first 6 chars is called Vendor Code and it's represetns who made this NIC.
# The next 6 chars is called unique value and it's repersents the exact machine that belongs to.
# Example => D2:51:F1:3A:34:65
