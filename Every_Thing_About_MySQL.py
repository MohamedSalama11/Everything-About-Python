# A Database :- is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed, in order to manage our databases we used a software application called DBMS (Database Management System)
### Difference Between SQL & MySQL ###
    # SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to perform various tasks such as inserting, updating, deleting or querying data in a database. SQL is not a database management system, but rather a language that database management systems use.
    # MySQL, on the other hand, is a popular Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its language for managing and manipulating data. MySQL is open-source and is widely used on the web and in enterprise applications.
    # In summary, SQL is a language used to work with databases while MySQL is a specific type of database management system that uses SQL as its language. Other popular RDBMS that use SQL include Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.
# DBMS Divided To:- 
    # 1- Relational Databases (SQL) => like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle
        # in relatoinal databases we used table that connected with each others by relationships
        # SQL (Structured Query Language) => is the language we use to work with Relational DBMS, or it is the language we use to talk to our databases
    # 2- Non Relational Databases or NoSQL
        # in non relational databases we don't have tables or relationships, don't understand SQL, they have their own query langauge
# Query => is the line of code you write with sql language
# When you learn sql language with any DBMS like mysql it's not that hard to switch to other DBMS that also uses sql language like (SQLite or PostgreSQL, Oracle )
